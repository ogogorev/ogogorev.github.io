      <p>
        Hi! I am a Front-end developer with almost 4 years of working
        experience. I&nbsp;love to create applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before I say anything about my technology stack, I would like to mention
        that I'm not afraid of complex tasks and implementing things myself, I
        love to develop apps from scratch and I feel confident learning new
        frameworks or technologies. I believe that these characteristics are
        more valuable and reliable then any programming language or framework
        knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        My main focus is Javascript (hence Typescript as well). I have decent
        knowledge of React and Angular and solid experience in working with HTML
        / CSS. I have no preferences and I'm ready to transform designs into
        layouts or implement intricate business logic, both with the same
        efficiency. I am familiar with Node.js and Express, Python, Machine
        Learning and have basic understanding of GameDev.
      </p>

      <h4>Background</h4>

      <p>
        I obtained my Bachelor and Master Degrees in Applied Mathematics and
        Computer Science from Omsk State University (Russia).
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2017 having gained two years of working experience as developer I
        moved to Germany, where I devoted myself to learning German language.
        Besides that I used this time to rethink my career and deepen my
        front-end knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since February 2019 I am working at Accenture as a front-end developer
        and now I'm ready to take the next step.
