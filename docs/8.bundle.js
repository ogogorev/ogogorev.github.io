Each chart is a function, that receives parameters from outside. I defined chart functions in old manner - using prototype inheritance.

All charts had a big performance issue, which I finally was able to solve. The issue was related to chart rendering - I used requestAnimationFrame function from the beginning, but not for all updates. Some of them were still triggered by mouse events (like mousemove). After moving all re-draws to requestAnimationFrame, performance improved significantly."}]}]}}]);
