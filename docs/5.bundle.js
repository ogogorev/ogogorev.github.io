It might seem similar to functional components in React - I use functions that get props as parameters and return root element with html, but there are some differences.

I consider this rather as an issue then as a feature and have some ideas of improving it."}]},{type:"h3",children:"This project has no dependencies"},{type:"p",children:[{type:"text",children:"I mean, it's written using Typescript and built with Webpack, but without any other dependencies.

The exported namespace defines "},{type:"code",children:"createElement"},{type:"text",children:" function that will be called each time a new node is created in jsx.

I collect them in the data folder and transform to json objects at build time. To achieve that I created markdown loader - it's very simple and naive.

So as you probably see, there is a big opportunity to improve it by transforming jsons to html at build time.
