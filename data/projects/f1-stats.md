# F1 Stats

[Demo](https://f1-stats.herokuapp.com/)

This is a demo project, created almost 3 years ago using React. It shows Formula 1 results and statistics, the data comes from open API ([https://ergast.com/mrd/](https://ergast.com/mrd/)).

I'm planning to refactor this project: use hooks, update design and rejuvenate the code.
